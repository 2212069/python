Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. 
His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass‚Äìenergy 
equivalence formula E = mc¬≤, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation." He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 
for his services to theoretical physics and his discovery of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in quantum theory. ...
